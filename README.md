# Where to Eat
The simple app for helping friends decide where to eat

## Deployment instructions

In order to deploy the app, you will need a Yelp api key, obtainable by registering an application on the Yelp api console.

Set either the `YELP_API_KEY` environment variable equal to your api key, or store it in `credentials/yelp-api-key.txt`

The app can then be run by running `npm install` followed by `npm start` from the application's root directory. Many production environments will do this for you.
